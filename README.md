# freeCodeCamp/Data Analysis with Python Projects/Medical Data Visualizer

In this project I used pandas to make some calculations on the data from a .csv file containing medical examination data and, also, I made visualizations of the data processed using matplotlib and seaborn. Below are the charts that I made with the data:
